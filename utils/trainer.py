# pretrain model for joint recognition on faces
# pretrain model for joint classification - pretrain on chest, then pretrain on joints from RSNA bone age to predict age and sex

# get weights from pretrains

# train landmarks on joints

# predict landmarks

# rescale landmarks to image size?
# use predicted landmarks to get images for individual joints(splits up in like 2-3 models for hands and 1-2 models for feet)*2 for erosion and narrowing


# train on individual joints


# send model to tester to predict test dataset
